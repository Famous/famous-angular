/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name faIndex
 * @module famous.angular
 * @restrict A
 * @description
 * This directive is used to specify the rendering order of elements
 * inside of a ViewSequence-based component, such as {@link faScrollView faScrollView}
 * or {@link faGridLayout faGridLayout}.  As a special case, when elements are added to
 * these controls using ng-repeat, they are automatically assigned the
 * $index property exposed by ng-repeat.  When adding elements manually
 * (e.g. to a faScrollView but not using ng-repeat) or in a case where custom
 * order is desired, then the index value must be assigned/overridden using the faIndex directive.
 * @usage
 * ```html
 * <fa-scroll-view>
 *  <fa-surface fa-index="0">Surface 1</fa-surface>
 *  <fa-surface fa-index="1">Surface 2</fa-surface>
 * </fa-scroll-view>
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * `Fa-index` determines the order of which the surfaces appear in the sequential view.
 * In this example below, a Scroll View is created with two nested `fa-view`'s, both of which have an `fa-index` of 0 and 1, respectively.
 *
 * If `fa-index` is declared explicitly, it will override any default order of `fa-view`'s declared in html.
 * If `fa-views` are created with an ng-repeat, they are automatically assigned the $index property, unless explicitly set.
 * The `fa-view` with the blue background color appears after the one with the red background because its `fa-index` is set to 1.
 *
 * `fa-scroll-view` accepts another directive called `fa-start-index` as an attribute, which determines which `fa-view` the Scroll View displays by default.
 * `Fa-start-index` will not affect the sequential order of the layout; the `fa-view` with the red background will be layed out first, followed by the one with the blue background.
 *  By setting `fa-start-index` to 1, the Scroll View will display the View with the index of 1, which is the View with the blue background color. 
 *
 * ```html
 *   <fa-app style="width: 320px; height: 568px;"> 
 *    <!-- The scroll View will start at the index of 1 -->
 *     <fa-scroll-view fa-pipe-from="eventHandler" fa-options="options.scrollView" fa-start-index="1">
 *       <!-- Even though this view is declared first in html, it will will be layed out 2nd -->
 *       <!-- On page load, the scroll View will scroll to this view, and display it.  -->
 *        <fa-view fa-index="1">
 *           <fa-modifier fa-size="[320, 568]">
 *              <fa-surface fa-pipe-to="eventHandler" 
 *                          fa-background-color="'blue'">
 *              </fa-surface>
 *           </fa-modifier>
 *        </fa-view>
 * 
 *        <fa-view fa-index="0">
 *           <fa-modifier fa-size="[320, 568]">
 *              <fa-surface fa-pipe-to="eventHandler" 
 *                          fa-background-color="'red'">
 *              </fa-surface>
 *           </fa-modifier>
 *        </fa-view>
 * 
 *     </fa-scroll-view>   
 *   </fa-app>   
 * ```
 *
 * ```javascript
 * var EventHandler = $famous['famous/core/EventHandler'];
 * $scope.eventHandler = new EventHandler();
 * $scope.list = [{content: "famous"}, {content: "angular"}, {content: "rocks!"}];
 *
 * $scope.options = {
 *   scrollView: {
 *     direction: 0 // displays the fa-views horizontally
 *   }
 * };
 *```
