# Famo.us/Angular [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Famous/famous-angular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Famous/famous-angular) [![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/famous-angular.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/famous-angular)

Add Famo.us interactions and animations to any AngularJS application and build Famo.us applications with AngularJS.

Using F/A, you can:
* Create Famo.us apps using familiar AngularJS tools like controllers, directives, and services.
* Bring rich Famo.us animations to new or existing AngularJS apps.
* Use HTML to declare Famo.us UIs, complete with Angular's two-way databinding.
* Easily integrate Famo.us and AngularJS apps.

##Installation

####Before you start, tools you will need:
* Download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Download and install [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* Install bower `npm install -g bower`

####Inside of your app:
* Run `bower install famous-angular`
* Add the following to your index.html
```html
  <script src="bower_components/famous/dist/famous-global.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/famous-angular/dist/famous-angular.js"></script>
```
* Add`<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/famous-angular/dist/famous-angular.css">` to the `<head>` of your index.html
* Add the `famous.angular` module to your Angular module list (e.g. in a main app.js file: `angular.module('yourMainModule', ['famous.angular'])`)
* And add an `<fa-app style="height: 200px"><fa-surface fa-background-color="'red'">Hello world</fa-surface></fa-app>` in one of your templates.  If you see 'Hello world' on a red background, you should be good to go.
**Note: currently, the element that the `<fa-app>` is on must be display: block (like a `<div fa-app>` or a `<p fa-app>`, or just `<fa-app>`) and must have a defined height (like `style="height: 200px"` in this example.)**


## CDN Dependencies
Here are a few CDN URLs for Famo.us and Famous-angular specific dependencies just in case you are not able to use bower or node for tooling in the app.  You will still need to ensure that you have Angular 1.2.26 in your project as it is a dependency for Famous-Angular.
