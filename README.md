# Famo.us/Angular

Famo.us/Angular is an AngularJS-powered framework for building Famo.us apps.

Using F/A, you can:
* Create Famo.us apps using familiar AngularJS tools like controllers, directives, and services.
* Bring rich Famo.us animations to new or existing AngularJS apps.
* Use HTML to declare Famo.us UIs, complete with Angular's two-way databinding.
* Easily integrate Famo.us and AngularJS apps.

This library is under active development and is currently in alpha.  The library is at a point where you can create powerful apps, and a lot of the core API is reasonably stabilized, but some things are expected to change as the project moves forward.  Contributors welcome! (see below)



##Running (For using F/A in your Angular app)

####Before you start, tools you will need
* Download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Download and install [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* Install bower `npm install bower`

####Inside of your app:
* Run `bower install famous-angular`
* Add the following to your index.html
```html
  <script src="bower_components/requirejs/require.js"></script>
  <script>
    //set requirejs's base to where the famous lib folder lives
    require.config({baseUrl: 'bower_components'});
  </script>
  <script src="bower_components/famous-angular/dist/famous-angular.js"></script>
```
* Add`<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/famous-angular/dist/famous-angular.css">` to the `<head>` of your index.html
* Add the `famous.angular` module to your Angular module list (e.g. in a main app.js file: `angular.module('yourMainModule',['famous.angular', 'ui.router', 'ngAnimate'])`)
* And add an `<fa-app style="height: 200px"><fa-surface fa-background-color="'red'">Hello world</fa-surface></fa-app>` in one of your templates.  If you see 'Hello world' on a red background, you should be good to go.
**Note: currently, the element that the `<fa-app>` is on must be display: block (like a `<div fa-app>` or a `<p fa-app>`, or just `<fa-app>`) and must have a set height (like `style="height: 200px"` in this example.)  Future versions will not have these requirements.**

####Build off of the starter app
To get started even faster, try the [famous-angular-starter](https://github.com/thomasstreet/famous-angular-starter) seed project, with everything already in place.  The starter app has a powerful gulp-based workflow, which includes live reloading and Jade/HAML support.



##Running (For developing or contributing to the library)

####Before you start, tools you will need
* Download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Download and install [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)

####First time:
`git clone https://github.com/thomasstreet/famous-angular.git`

`npm install`

`npm install -g gulp`

####Thereafter:
`npm start`

Npm start will use gulp to concatenate files into famous-angular.js, which is built into the app folder. It will also watch for changes inside app and livereload as necessary.

As configured, you should be able to access the application at localhost:4000.

####To develop the library using the famous-angular-examples submodule

`gulp dev`

####To build the docs

`gulp docs`

####To run tests

`karma start`
