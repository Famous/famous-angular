# Famo.us/Angular [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Famous/famous-angular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Famous/famous-angular)

Famo.us/Angular is an AngularJS-driven framework for building Famo.us apps.

[Project Site](https://famo.us/angular)

###Download
[Famo.us/Angular Starter Kit](http://code.famo.us/famous-angular/latest/famous-angular-starter-kit.zip?src=github-readme)
  or
`bower install famous-angular`


Using F/A, you can:
* Create Famo.us apps using familiar AngularJS tools like controllers, directives, and services.
* Bring rich Famo.us animations to new or existing AngularJS apps.
* Use HTML to declare Famo.us UIs, complete with Angular's two-way databinding.
* Easily integrate Famo.us and AngularJS apps.


##Project Roadmap

##Running (For using F/A in your Angular app)

####Before you start, tools you will need
* Download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Download and install [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* Install bower `npm install -g bower`

####Inside of your app:
* Run `bower install famous-angular`
* Add the following to your index.html
```html
  <script src="bower_components/famous/famous-global.js"></script>
  <script src="bower_components/famous-angular/dist/famous-angular.js"></script>
```
* Add`<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/famous-angular/dist/famous-angular.css">` to the `<head>` of your index.html
* Add the `famous.angular` module to your Angular module list (e.g. in a main app.js file: `angular.module('yourMainModule',['famous.angular', 'ui.router', 'ngAnimate'])`)
* And add an `<fa-app style="height: 200px"><fa-surface fa-background-color="'red'">Hello world</fa-surface></fa-app>` in one of your templates.  If you see 'Hello world' on a red background, you should be good to go.
**Note: currently, the element that the `<fa-app>` is on must be display: block (like a `<div fa-app>` or a `<p fa-app>`, or just `<fa-app>`) and must have a set height (like `style="height: 200px"` in this example.)  Future versions will not have these requirements.**


####Build off of the starter app
To get started even faster, try the [famous-angular-starter](https://github.com/thomasstreet/famous-angular-starter) seed project, with everything already in place.  The starter app has a powerful gulp-based workflow, which includes live reloading and Jade/HAML support.




##Running (For developing or contributing to the library)

####Before you start, tools you will need
* Download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Download and install [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)

####First time:
`git clone https://github.com/thomasstreet/famous-angular.git`

`npm install`

`npm install -g gulp`


####Thereafter:
Clone the submodules and install the frontend dependencies inside of your example folder.

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

`cd famous-angular-examples`

`bower install`

`cd ..`

`npm start`

Npm start will use gulp to concatenate files into famous-angular.js, which is built into the app folder. It will also watch for changes inside app and livereload as necessary.

Then open http://localhost:4000.

####To develop the library using the famous-angular-examples submodule

`gulp dev`

####To build the docs

`gulp docs`

####To run tests
Ensure that you have the [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/intro/installation.html) command line interface installed.
'npm install -g karma-cli'

`karma start'

## CDN Dependencies
Here are a few CDN URLs for Famo.us and Famous-angular specific dependencies just in case you are not able to use bower or node for tooling in the app.  You will still need to ensure that you have Angular 1.2.26 in your project as it is a dependency for Famous-Angular.

Famo.us:
* http://code.famo.us/famous/0.3/famous-global.js
* http://code.famo.us/famous/0.3/famous.js
* http://code.famo.us/famous/0.3/famous.css

Famous-Angular:
* http://code.famo.us/famous-angular/0.4.0/famous-angular.js
* http://code.famo.us/famous-angular/0.4.0/famous-angular.css

##Contributing

We would love to have community contributions and support!  A few areas where could use help right now:

* Writing tests
* Elaborating on documentation
* Creating examples for the docs
* Bug reports and/or fixes
* Continuing to wrap Famo.us layouts and views into directives [advanced]
